Below is a rough sketch of the big trips and events in the Outdoor Community Calendar. If you join one of WUCC or Warwick Mountains then you need to pay for the Sports Federation and for the Warwick SU Club Pass. At this point it only costs a very small amount to join any other sports clubs so you might as well join the other outdoorsy club as well. In previous years keen climbers have joined both clubs and taken advantage of all the trips on offer; you only get one life, after all.

WUCC Trips tend to be posted on its [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/213573838712663) as well as organised via email. All Warwick Mountains Trips are organised via email.

WUCU Trips are more ad-hoc and are organised via our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3206887099412017).
