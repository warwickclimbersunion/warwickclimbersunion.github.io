# Go Outdoors
There is a [Go Outdoors store](https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/stores/coventry) next to Canley station. It is only half an hour walk from campus or alternatively you can catch catch the [free shuttle bus](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/estates/transport/buses/shuttlebus/) to the station.

Go Outdoors offers a [price match guarantee](https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/price-guarantee) where they will beat any price given by another UK based company by 10%. You price match online or in store.

They also do a [10% student discount](https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/students) which you get by showing your student card at the checkout.

Note that you may need to buy a Go Outdoors membership card to access these offers. If your flatmate has a discount card then [you are allowed to use that](https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/discount-card-terms-and-conditions).

# Decthalon
Decathlon does own-brand climbing gear which is much cheaper, but of lower quality, than that which you can buy at Go Outdoors. It's a good option for people who want to buy their first pieces of climbing gear and don't want to spend too much. The [Decathlon store](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/store-view/sport-shop-coventry-0070071700717) is much further away from campus than the Go Outdoors store (15 minute drive/45 minute cycle).

# Other Cheap Gear Options
* [Google Shopping](https://www.google.com/shopping) indexes most of the UK based online gear stores so it is always worth comparing your price against it.
* Facebook marketplace groups [Outdoor Gear Exchange UK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/usedgearexchangeuk/) and [Climbing Gear Exchange UK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/733963366659553) are places where people commonly sell second hand climbing gear. See below for which items to avoid.
* [Rock + Run](https://rockrun.com/) are known for occasionally having very good deals on. They are always worth checking.
* [Cotswold Outdoor](https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/our-partners/bmc.html), [Up and Under](http://www.upandunder.co.uk/Blog/archive/2013/12/bmc-discount-code/), [Snow + Rock](https://www.snowandrock.com/?utm_source=PartnerPage&utm_campaign=BMC&utm_medium=Website) and [Absolute Snow](https://www.absolute-snow.co.uk/services/partners-programme-club-discounts) offer a 15% discount to BMC members. This discount can sometimes make one of these the cheapest option. If you are a paid up member of either WUCC or WUCU you are also a member of the BMC by affiliation. See the [BMC website](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/get-discounts-in-shops-nationwide) a full list of stores where you can get a BMC discount. 
* [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=chalk+bag&_sacat=0&_sop=15&rt=nc&LH_Auction=1) is a good place to pick up a second hand chalk bag for cheap. For boulderers, the cheapest option is just putting a chalk ball in a sandwich bag.
* A lot of websites will include postage for free if you reach a certain price threshold. You can take advantage of this by asking your friends or posting on the WUCC or WUCU Facebook groups to see if anyone else wants to get something from the same website, thereby meeting the threshold and having no postage costs to pay.

# Cheap Gear to Avoid
* [Unrated carabiners from Amazon, eBay or eleswhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/b685vi/new_climbers_do_not_use_amazon_for_gear_unless/). For more info on gear ratings, see [this Rock and Ice article](https://rockandice.com/gear/buying-tips/making-sense-of-the-uiaa-ce-and-3-sigma-ratings/).
* Second hand rope, harnesses, slings or helmets, [for safety reasons](https://blog.weighmyrack.com/buying-used-climbing-gear/). The exception to this is if you trust the seller to accurately confirm the items's age, level of use, and whether it has taken any stress or damage.
* Decthalon chalk because it's rubbish. Rock Technologies chalk is a good cheap option, [available at Go Outdoors](https://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/15899255/rock-technologi-chalk-ball-15899255) and you can use the student discount.
* Beemat boulder pads aren't worth it even at low prices.

# Borrowing Gear
* You can borrow helmets, bouldering pads and guidebooks from WUCC (paying a deposit), but make sure to look after them and to give them back!
* The university library has two books on climbing injury prevention and treatment. [Make Or Break](https://encore.lib.warwick.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3069074__Smake%20or%20break__Orightresult__U__X6?lang=eng&suite=cobalt) and [One Move Too Many](https://encore.lib.warwick.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3069075__Sone%20move%20too%20many__Orightresult__U__X6?lang=eng&suite=cobalt). WUCC also has a copy of One Move Too Many you can borrow.
* The university library has a respectable collection of general [rock climbing](https://encore.lib.warwick.ac.uk/iii/encore/search/C__SRock%20climbing.__Ff%3Afacetmediatype%3Aa%3Aa%3APrint%20Book%3A%3A__Orightresult__X0?lang=eng&suite=cobalt) and [mountaineering](https://encore.lib.warwick.ac.uk/iii/encore/search/C__SMountaineering.__Ff%3Afacetmediatype%3Aa%3Aa%3APrint%20Book%3A%3A__Orightresult__X0?lang=eng&suite=cobalt) books.
