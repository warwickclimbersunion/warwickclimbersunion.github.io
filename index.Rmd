Welcome to the WUCU website! 

# Our Mission
We are an organisation for University of Warwick climbers and mountaineers that is independent of Warwick SU and Warwick Sport. We organise cheap rock climbing and bouldering trips to the Peak District, Wales, the Wye Valley, Leicestershire and beyond! 

For more information about our club please see [our manifesto](manifesto.html).

If you're interested in coming outside with us then check out [our trips page](trips.html) and join [our Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3206887099412017){target="_blank"}. All students and alumni are welcome!
