Welcome to the WUCU website! 

# Our Mission
We are an organisation for student and alumni climbers that is independent of Warwick SU and Warwick Sport. We organise cheap climbing trips to the Peak District, the Wye Valley, Leicestershire and beyond! 

For more information please see [our manifesto](manifesto.html).

If you're interested in coming outside with us then check out [our trips page](trips.html).
