  <b>Favourite Climb:</b> "After hearing rumours of a king line established in Warwickshire, I stocked up on psych by watching every Reel Rock film over the course of two days. Filled with psych and a hardened resolve to become a climbing icon, we went to Corley Rocks to eventually free one of the most inspiring lines of our times: <a href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/corley_rocks-17459/warwickshire_sport-481132">Warwickshire Sport</a>. This line shaped my journey in climbing and provided a near out-of-body spiritual experience as I topped out."
