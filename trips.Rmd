Since our establishment in September 2020 we have visited:

* [Biblins Cave in the Wye Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngWcd3wjUfE)
* [Raven Tor in the Peak District](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFtzENqFHMa/) [(twice!)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-bewCAGZa/)
* [Burbage North and West Edges in the Peak District](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGXk7OpgUSB/)
* [John's Frankland's Untitled Boulder at Compton Verney, Warwickshire](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ8cIk-D6qt/)
* [Forest Rock in Woodhouse Eaves, Leicestershire](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHo0puD1J3/)

We hope to visit many more crags around the UK in the coming year.

At the moment we are limited to doing day trips but we hope to one day organise weekend trips and perhaps even international tours!

For photos and videos of what we get up to feel free to check out our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/warwick_climbers_union/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICcXE7dYugbFBRfbdjl90Q) pages.
