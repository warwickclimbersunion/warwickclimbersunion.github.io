WUCU exists in response to Warwick SU and Warwick Sport erecting substantial financial barriers in the way of student participation in sport. These organisations hold access to sport hostage and extort large sums of money from students by exploiting their passion for their sports. The affiliated sports clubs are given almost none of this extorted money back in funding. These financial barriers have increased year after year and fewer and fewer students are able to afford to participate in sport. This has created substantial inequalities in access to sport, with only those from economically privileged backgrounds able to afford the costs of participation. 

The cost of a climbing membership was £120 in X. In 2020/1 it is now £210, with a £7 registration fee. In 2017 Warwick Sport introduced the club pass which extorts a further £Y from students who would like to belong to a sports club. The WUUC executive committee asked the Students’ Union to fight these price increases on our behalf but unfortunately our sabbatical officers proved to be completely ineffectual.

WUCC members paid a total of X to join, the club received back Y. This is appalling value for money etc etc. 

In the 2020/1 academic year if you want to climb you have to pay the new higher cost of climbing membership, but this leaves many unable to afford to join the club and thus they miss out on opportunities to go climbing outdoors. The solution to this problem is an organisation which will run outdoor climbing that is unaffiliated with Warwick SU and Warwick Sport. Members of the unaffiliated organisation do not have to pay the extortionate Sports Federation or Club Pass fees. The elimination of these costs means students are more likely to be able to afford to climb both indoors and outdoors. This organisation would give students who are priced out of WUCC membership something they can afford to belong to and to provide them with a sense of community.

This is WUCU’s mission: to be an organisation which facilitates University of Warwick students access to outdoor climbing, while keeping the cost to students as low as possible. We believe that all those who attend Warwick should be able to access outdoor climbing regardless of their economic circumstances or background.
